                  <p>This privacy policy was last updated on June 1, 2016</p>
                  <p>This privacy policy ("privacy policy") explains how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information of visitors of our LearnEngg web site (the "site") and users of our products and services (the "services"). Please note that the primary purpose of our site and the services are to allow you to enroll in and take online courses on a variety of topics ("courses"). For the purpose of this privacy policy, information that you provide through the site can be in one of two categories: information relating to your use of the site or the services, including, without limitation, enrollment information for courses, referred to as "site information," while information relating to taking the courses, including, without limitation, interactions with the course instructors ("instructors"), other students ("users"), answers, essays and other items submitted to satisfy course requirements, is referred to as "course information." When this privacy policy uses the generic term "information" it is intended to address the general use of information, and not your specific site information or course information. By using the site, services, or courses you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable site information and course information, as applicable, in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
                  <h1 class="sub-heading">1. Personally identifiable information we collect and how we use it</h1>
                  <p>You can generally visit the site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. We do not collect personal information from our site visitors without the site visitor voluntarily providing us with this information as set forth in this privacy policy.</p>
                  <p>If you request to receive company or product information, or request information about specific services, or provide comments about services, you will be asked to provide contact information so that we can complete your request. We use this site information to fulfill your request. We may also use this site information to send you additional information about our services or courses on the site that you may be interested in.</p>
                  <p>Some of the services require that you become a registered user and create a user account. This will require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, that may include (but not be limited to) your name (and if you are enrolling as part of our LearnEngg for business program, your company's name), e-mail address, as well as telephone and address information.</p>
                  <p>You thus allow us to use this personally identifiable site information to register yourself to use the services, enroll in courses, and otherwise provide you with the services; verify your authority to enter the site and access the courses and services; notify you of updates; improve the content and general administration of the site and the services; provide you with notices regarding the services and other services that you have purchased or may wish to purchase in the future.</p>
                  <p>You also consent to our providing this personally identifiable information to instructors as part of the course information when you enroll in a course. Instructors will use this course information to provide the course to you. Instructors may have other users for course information. It is your responsibility when you enroll in a course to confirm what uses the instructor will make of your personally identifiable course information. LearnEngg does not control these uses by instructors.</p>
                  <h1 class="sub-heading">2. Other information we collect and how we use it</h1>
                  <p>The Company may also automatically collect and analyze site information about your general usage of the site, services and courses. We might track your usage patterns to see what features of the site, services and courses you commonly use, site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser, browser language, ip address and operating system, and statistical information about how you use the services and courses. We only collect, track and analyze such site information in an aggregate manner that does not personally identify you. This aggregate data may be used to assist us in operating the site and the services and provided to other third parties to enable them to better understand the operation of the services, and improve their course offerings, but such information will be in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable data.</p>
                  <p>Instructors may collect non-personally identifiable course information in connection with your participation in courses. This course information may include, but not be limited to, your interaction with the instructor and other users, comments you leave on course forums, answers or essays you submit to satisfy course requirements, and so forth. As noted above, it is your responsibility to review the instructor's policy in connection with all course information and decide whether or not you want to provide such course information.</p>
                  <h1 class="sub-heading">3. Children</h1>
                  <p>We recognize the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. This site is not intended for children under the age of 13 and we endeavor not to collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. The Company targets its services and this site is addressed to mainly students above the age of 13 Years and Faculties and not to children under the age of 13.</p>
                  <h1 class="sub-heading">4. Disclosure of information</h1>
                  <p>We will share your personally identifiable site information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. These include, but are not limited to, sharing site information with service providers to allow them to fulfill your requests, to instructors (in which case this will become course information), and to your employer if you are enrolled through the LearnEngg for business program as an employee. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. Please refer to the sections above on personally identifiable and other course information for how course information may be used.</p>
                  <p>We may also disclose your personally identifiable information: (a) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an investigation of a governmental authority, (b) to enforce these terms of use, or (c) to protect the safety of users of our site and our services and courses. In addition, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization.</p>
                  <h1 class="sub-heading">5. Data retention</h1>
                  <p>We retain site information and the personal data we process on behalf of users for as long as needed to provide the services. We will retain and use this personal site information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements with users, and/or the period required by laws in applicable jurisdictions.
